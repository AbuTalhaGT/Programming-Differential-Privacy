# Programming-Differential-Privacy
This repository is made of the Jupyter Notebook from the online book Programming Differential Privacy. I appreciate the efforts of the author for making the difficult concepts easy to understand.

Just go through the Dataset and the notebook in order from Chapter 1 onwards.
